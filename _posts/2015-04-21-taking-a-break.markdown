A lot of developers, students, and even teachers forget how important a small break is. And I don't mean the 5 minute bathroom break you take every few hours. I mean a real 2-3 day break, a "mini-vacation." Go do something! It's great that you're learning web development for 6-8 hours a day, but I promise burn out is right around the corner.

The one great thing about programming is the immense amount of things to learn. Senior developers are known to say "you never stop learning." In other careers it's the opposite. The experienced workers usually think they have it all figured out, and that their learning days are over. There is no need to rush through books and tutorials. Take your time, take a few days off, relax and have some fun.

I was lucky enough to take a week off school and focus on personal projects. Although I spent most of my time playing games and hanging with family and friends, at night I would work on my node.js content management system, drink tea, and keep up to date with web dev news. It feels great to spend some time away from the keyboard and mouse. A lot of developers only take time off when their project is complete. I find the most optimal way of avoiding burnout is to take small breaks (a day or two) WHILE working on a project.
