My goal here, is to lay out a basic pathway to learning programming, and link to some of the best resources I've found on my journey. I will be basing my resources on the general guide from [Google's Technical Guide.](https://www.google.ca/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html) With this general guide, I will recommend learning resources to use along the way. 

The first step Google mentions, is an Introductory Course to Computer Science. Great start! They provide a few recommendations, but I have a better idea. Let's take the first step (Introductory Course) and combine it with the second and third step. edX offers a free (unless you would like a certificate upon completion) Introductory Course from Harvard University, called CS50. This foundation will provide you with CS logic, and you will create projects using a variety of programming languages such as, C, PHP, JavaScript, and more! This course is renowned for its difficulty, but don't be discouraged if you have trouble, that's completely normal. Remember this is just the start of your journey!

The next step is to choose your first language. This is completely dependent of what your goals are, but I suggest learning an OOP language. I'm going to use the web development path as an example for this part. So we know X things about web development. HTML (markup language) and CSS (styling language) are required for creating a web page. But let's be honest, those really aren't programming languages, and therefore you won't learn programming by learning them. JavaScript is a huge component in todays web development. It's also a programming language! With the growth of node.js I would recommend learning JavaScript! Visit [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) for a really great JavaScript path.

What if you don't want to learn JavaScript? Let me start by saying, I'm not sure why you wouldn't, it's taking over the web, but I understand and will provide you with some other awesome resources. For Ruby on Rails, checkout [the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/), for PHP check out this [Quora question.](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-PHP-1) 

Now, you should be pretty familiar with one or more programming languages. So learn another one! It's always good to learn multiple languages, just don't rush it. This will give you another tool to use, and a new perspective on programming. It helps a lot to add a new language to your repertoire. It also provides more job opportunities, that's always a plus.

The final note I will leave, TESTING. Learn testing. It's a great skill to learn and understand, and it will always be a benefit to your programming skills. Both The Odin Project and Free Code Camp cover testing in their curriculum, just don't skip it because you don't find value in it at this point!
