I want to start off by giving you the best programming advice you will ever receive. The fastest way to learn to program, is by creating something you've always wanted. I've been working on a simple, yet intensive League of Legends web application that I thought would be awesome. It's always been a goal of mine to create something useful for a community that I was involved with, and let me tell you, I love it.

I've learned more in a day building this project than in a month of watching tutorials and reading books. The passion, the motivation, the determination. You experience all of this while building something you've always wanted to build, or something that's always interested you. Why is this? Why does building something benefit you so much?

This answer can be broken up into a few pieces. The first and most obvious; it's real-world experience. You're creating an application that will have a use in the real world, and not just following along with a youtube video building something that 3000 others are building. You're solving a problem. Whether that impacts thousands, or just you, it doesn't matter.

Secondly, you wouldn't be working on this project if it didn't interest you. Because of this interest, you will work harder, and longer. You'll sacrifice sleep and skip meals trying to overcome issues that arise while developing. This is a good thing (as long as you don't overdue it). You're motivated, something you only experience when working on something that interests you.

Lastly, this is how how you learn. Point blank. "You learn by doing", you'll see this posted all over IRC's, web dev subreddits, and chatrooms. Web development is one giant, never ending puzzle. You will solve one problem, and then another, until your project is ready for launch. Even after deployment issues will appear. That's what it's all about. Not only are you learning how to solve these issues for the future, you're learning how to emotionally handle them.
