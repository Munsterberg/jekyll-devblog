#### Tuesday

Monday was homework day, so I won't talk too much about it. I started working on
a Todo application using rails. It's a good project that covers the CRUD
operations with rails. I don't plan on spending much time on it, just something
simple - a little checklist kinda app.

I also dove back into CS50, watched a few more lectures. I'm enjoying the
content, but it's not teaching me much I don't already know. Bookmarked a few
books that I plan on buying in the future, mostly regarding algorithms.

#### Wednesday

Most of the day was spent doing homework and a little bit of reading for The
Odin Project. I did switch from Sublime Text to Atom for my text-editor of
choice, which I'm thinking of writing a blog post about. A lot of handy packages
and it's completely open source. I don't think sublime's business model will
compete with the free text-editors like Atom and Brackets.

I do most of my work in Webstorm or IntelliJ, but Atom is great for when you want
to boot up something quick and do a bit of coding. I also prefer the speed and
agility of a light-weight text editor. 

#### Thursday

Definitely a more productive day. Made the final decision that I will be
dropping ruby and rails for a while and focusing primarily on the MEAN stack.
I have a friend that will be learning to program with me during the summer, and
he's planning on starting with ruby, so I will pick it back up then.

I started reading "Node The Right Way", but I really want to perfect my
javascript skills before I jump deep into node and angular. I bookmarked a few
javascript books, and used a coupon to purchase a javascript course and an
angular course on Udemy.

#### Friday

Began watching the lectures(?) for the javascript course on Udemy. Off to a pretty
good start. Javascript is a very unique and weird language, thankfully the teacher
explains it all very well.

I spent some time doing the node courses from Codeschool. Freecodecamp is great
for the resources they provide, and the community is even better. Someone recommended
eggschool.io to me for angular, looks promising, bookmarked for later.

Near the end of the day I was fiending for a project using the MEAN stack. Luckily
I stumbled upon Bossable's 30 day MEAN stack challenge on youtube, it's something
I can follow along with and build something while learning. Got a few parts deep
before I got too tired.

### Conclusion

All in all it was another short week with more time spent learning than coding.
But I guess that's the benefit of being a student and unemployed though. I've
been doing A LOT of reading when it comes to programming. Which is unusual because
I prefer to not read about programming in my spare time. Have a good weekend guys!
