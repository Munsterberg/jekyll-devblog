Jekyll is known for it's ease of use, maintainability, and easy deployment. But what if it's your first time on the block, and you run into a few issues. Well here's a simple guide:

After you have your jekyll blog developed and ready for launch, simply enter the root of it using terminal. After you're at the terminal type <$ jekyll> This will create a new folder in the root of your site called "_site". This is the folder you will use to deploy your website.

Next, find a host and a domain. For this example we will use HostGator.
