A new series of blog posts I want to start, documenting what I've learned this week. This is more for me than anyone else. It seems like an effective way to retain things that I've learned in the past week. I was inspired after visiting one of the Mozilla engineer's personal blog.

### What I've Been Focusing On

#### Monday && Tuesday

I've been hearing so many good things about Harvard's CS50 course I decided to enroll. I plan on just skimming through the material and checking out some of their lectures. It should be a valuable addition to my programming journey! This week, I've watched the Week 0 and 1 lectures and enjoyed them. Although it's directed towards a total beginner, I still found them amusing and informal. I created an evernote to take notes on the course just in case, but found myself a little above the beginning material. 

After trying the new Ruby on Rails codecademy course, I decided to dive into the odin project. I've been loving it so far. I know people say that it's a mistake learning multiple languages simultaneously, but I found it to be a benefit rather than a detriment. TOP (The Odin Project) has me creating a CMS using rails, and it's been quite the trip. I've been having trouble grasping ruby symbols fully, but I've been making progress. 

I spent most of the day completing boring homework :(.

Later on in the night I noticed a small hiccup with the hamburger menu on my website, the background color is incorrect, will have to deploy fixes in the morning!
