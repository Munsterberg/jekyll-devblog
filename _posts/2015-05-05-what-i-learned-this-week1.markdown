A new series of blog posts I want to start, documenting what I've learned this week. This is more for me than anyone else. It seems like an effective way to retain things that I've learned in the past week. I was inspired after visiting one of the Mozilla engineer's personal blog.

### What I've Been Focusing On

#### Monday && Tuesday

I've been hearing so many good things about Harvard's CS50 course I decided to enroll. I plan on just skimming through the material and checking out some of their lectures. It should be a valuable addition to my programming journey! This week, I've watched the Week 0 and 1 lectures and enjoyed them. Although it's directed towards a total beginner, I still found them amusing and informal. I created an evernote to take notes on the course just in case, but found myself a little above the beginning material. 

After trying the new Ruby on Rails codecademy course, I decided to dive into the odin project. I've been loving it so far. I know people say that it's a mistake learning multiple languages simultaneously, but I found it to be a benefit rather than a detriment. TOP (The Odin Project) has me creating a CMS using rails, and it's been quite the trip. I've been having trouble grasping ruby symbols fully, but I've been making progress. 

I spent most of the day completing boring homework :(.

Later on in the night I noticed a small hiccup with the hamburger menu on my website, the background color is incorrect, will have to deploy fixes in the morning!

### Wednesday

Today has mostly been spent doing homework. I also learned how much I hate the design of Wikipedia and sites alike. I will omit anything regarding homework unless it's something interesting.

### Thursday

I wanted to dive right into coding because of yesterday. So I started working on by rails blogging system. Authentication to be exact, which I've only played with in PHP and node.js using EveryAuth and Passport.js. After a lot of git commits, and working slow, I think I'm starting to understand ruby symbols, yay! Using a gem called Sorcery, I implemented a login system into the rails CMS, working good. Authenticated the necessary functions as well. Can mark that project as complete, but may come back and work on it in the future. 

I'm still dedicated to Harvard's CS50 course. With a mixture of that, some FreeCodeCamp bonfires, and more homework :(, the rest of the day should go by pretty smooth. CS50 is getting a little more advanced in Week 2, maybe I will gain something from these lectures.

While watching the lectures and looking for some more MEAN stack learning resources I was advised to check out Bossable's 30 day MEAN stack challenge. Going to take a look at that later tonight. Also came to the sudden realization that I'm juggling an enormous amount of goals and languages. Let me list a few: the entire MEAN stack for web development, Java and Python for school projects, C for CS50, Ruby on Rails for when I'm bored, and PHP for a project with a group of friends. This is abnormal, and I need to start sifting through and finding what I really need to learn. In the end I am learning programming with all of the above, but it's causing more harm with confusion than it's doing good.

### Friday

Unfortunately, I could barely get any coding done today. My dog was neutered and I spent most of the day watching him. I'm actually writing this at 1AM believe it or not. I'm looking for something to do to keep me awake until I can swap shifts with someone for my dog lol. This late night will be spent reading a bit of The Odin Project, and possibly doing FreeCodeCamp bonfires to stay awake and get some coding in.

### Final Thoughts
