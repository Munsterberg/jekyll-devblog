### Monday
I spent a lot of time working on a personal app over the weekend. Learned quite
a bit, ran into a lot of problems, and drank a lot of tea. I decided to drop
CS50 as it wasn't worth the time sink for my current programming knowledge. I
think the quality is great and the professors are awesome, but if you're not a
beginner or close to it, I would recommend skipping or skimming it.

I really like reading through Eloquent Javascript, even if I know a lot of the
material. I realize that sort of contradicts the earlier paragraph, but oh well :).
It provides a good read before I start taking node and angular seriously. I
also watched a bit of Udemy's Javascript - Understanding the Weird Parts.
Off to a great start and will definitely continue watching.

### Tuesday
After kind of flailing all over the place Monday I decided I need a better way
to plan out my day. Google Calendar for schedule, and Trello for task management
should serve me well. Unfortunately, my sleep schedule is still out of wack, so
it will be a few days before I abide by my calendar.

Most of the upcoming days will be spent on homework, so expect a lot less content.
I filled my head with straight vanilla javascript knowledge today. Developing
a strong understanding of the base language should provide me a clear path
to learning more about node, angular, and all the other crazy frameworks.

I also realized while writing this, that my original idea of jotting down everything
I learned, quickly became a personal programming journal. I'm pleased with the
results either way.

### Wednesday
Began the day by working on my personal project after finding a solution to
the problem I was having. I had to delete the previous TTL index's in mongoose
before the new ones kicked in. This issue arose because I didn't spend enough
time reading the docs, instead I did a little experimentation.

After completing my homework for the day I started watching javascript - the weird
parts again. Great way to pass the time and fill my head with vanilla javascript
knowledge. I definitely need to spend some time learning testing though. I think
that will be my goal next week.

### Thursday
A lot of time is being spent on my personal project. I sort of just went into
beast mode today and didn't take any notes on what I was doing. So this blog
post is going to be kinda weak. Between the project and homework, I just didn't
have time to write out my blog. But, I did learn a lot more about MongoDB, and
it doesn't deserve the amount of hype it gets. Postgres or any SQL DBMS is still
viable, and better for suitable projects.

### Friday
Woke up early to begin working on my personal project again. My goal is to make
a request to the Riot API and validate the JSON information with the form information
before submitting the data to the database. I haven't done much work with API's
so this should be a pretty big challenge for me.

After lots of hacking I finally got most of it working. A few more revisions and
I should be in the clear.

### Late Friday & Saturday
Lots of work done on my personal project. My planned application is complete,
but it still feels a bit "blank", if that makes sense. While working out the bugs
before deploying, I will be trying to come up with a few more ideas.

As for what I learned, lots about callbacks. I thought I understood how functions
can be passed around in javascript. But, it will be a while before I truly
grasp functional programming. Soon I will be competent hopefully.

More homework, and that's it for the week!
