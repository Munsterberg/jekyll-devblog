#### Wednesday
Monday and Tuesday were spent looking after my dog that just underwent surgery, along with a bit of homework. So, I'll skip straight to Wednesday where I started at it again!

I wanted to learn some more theory and beginner logic so I watched a few more CS50 lectures. This introduction course is great for learning the basics in a fun and interactive way. They provide visual representations for each concept they teach.

After watching the lectures I decided to hit The Odin Project once again. With a mixture of TOP (The Odin Project), and Codeschool's Ruby track I should have Rails mastered by the end of the month. I think I will pick up MEAN or PHP afterwards, possibly even Python/Django. Although I am constantly buried in new things to learn, I don't ever want to become stagnant. As long as I'm learning, I'm progressing. People get trapped into "choosing the right language", "finding the best materials", they forget that they are still learning, and therefore getting closer to a career in programming. I over-think way too often myself about this, and need to just focus on pushing forward. 

#### Thursday
Good day. Started working on a Poll application using MEN (Mongodb, Express, Node). I want to avoid diving deep into angular until 2.X or whatever that big update is that should be coming this summer. Got familiar with the basic CRUD functions and started chopping at it. I purchased about 4 books related to node when I started learning it, beginning tomorrow I'm going to start reading them. 

Sidenote: Learning rails and its MVC structure helped so much with node. Once you understand the true concept of MVC you just sky rocket into the language, it feels great. 

#### Friday
Things are moving fast. I chose to read 'Practical Node' and 'Beginner Node Book' first. I was already a little advanced for Beginner Node, but I picked up a few things skimming through. I tried reading through a node related book a while back (can't remember which), but I just wasn't understanding things. It feels good to finally being able to pick things up, thats how I know I'm making progress. 

I've been taking on this 'bootcamp' mentality and studying for most of the day. I only took time off today to eat and go to the bathroom haha. I'm still focusing on both the MEAN stack and Rails, not sure if its counter procutive or not, but I'm having a good time and it's keeping me motivated.
