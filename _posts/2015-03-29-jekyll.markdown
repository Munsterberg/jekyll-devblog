I've been straying away from WordPress for a few months now. It's great for quick easy websites that need a content management system (CMS). But the downside is that it provides a lot of features I doubt most will make use of. When creating my old website, I wanted to integrate a blog. It was a static site, so there was no need for a CMS like Drupal or WordPress (WP). I was unable to find something that I understood at the time. So I just went with WP. It was a struggle, because I just wanted something to make blog posts with. The result? I ended up posting about 4 blog posts before giving up. 

I finally decided to give in, and try Jekyll, which was recommended by almost everyone I spoke to. It fits what I need perfectly. This website was developed with just a few purposes in mind.

- Simplicity

- Maintainability

- Customization

Jekyll provided all 3 of these. In fact, I believe it was designed for these reasons. I spent a majority of the week developing and tweaking the site, and I'm happy how it turned out. It checkmarked each requirement I had for my personal website. 

In the next few days I will be doing a few more tweaks before deployment, and still focusing on node.js development. I am almost finished a CMS developed using node, with authentication, and a complete admin section. Stay tuned!
