	<p class="portfolio-blurb"><strong>Summary:</strong> One of my first extensive node projects was to create a simple toy CMS with authorization. The scope of this project was small, but it was a learning experience. In no way is this a complete CMS, it was mostly to learn CRUD operations with MongoDB and Node.js.</p>
	<p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> Node.js, Express Framework, EveryAuth Module, MongoDB, Jade, Gulp.</p>
	<p><strong>Length:</strong> About 2 weeks of off and on development. I was in the process of learning Node.js.</p>
