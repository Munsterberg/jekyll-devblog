	<p class="portfolio-blurb"><strong>Summary:</strong> I love creating small content management systems for an initial project when learning a language. This was my very first project using PHP. Included was all of the CRUD operations of MySQL and login/register functionality.</p>
	<p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> HTML, PHP, CSS.</p>
	<p><strong>Length:</strong> This was very small, only took about a day to complete.</p>
