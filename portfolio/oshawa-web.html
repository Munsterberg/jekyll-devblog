	<p class="portfolio-blurb"><strong>Summary:</strong> This was mostly a design project using the Foundation CSS framework. I scrapped this project half way through for this current website. I found the "gawdy" design hard to maintain when it's main purpose was a personal programming journal.</p>
	<p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Foundation Framework, PHP, Photoshop, Illustrator.</p>
	<p><strong>Length:</strong> About 1 week for the general design, and another week to put it into action.</p>
