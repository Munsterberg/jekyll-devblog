    <p class="portfolio-blurb"><strong>Summary: </strong>Turnkeyss was a small static site project that required
        delicate
        attention from a
        dedicated developer. I worked with the client over email to create a design strategy and to understand exaclty what they wanted implemented. They expressed the fact they wanted to include a lot of sliders, a contact form, and make use of a google map API.</p>
    <p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> HTML, SASS, PHP, JavaScript, PhotoShop, and Illustrator.</p>
    <p><strong>Length:</strong> This project was short and concise. It was developed and deployed in under a week.</p>
