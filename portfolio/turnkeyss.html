    <p class="portfolio-blurb"><strong>Summary: </strong>Turnkeyss was a small static site project that required
        delicate
        attention from a
        dedicated developer. I worked with the client over email to create a design strategy and what they want
        implemented. The client was very specific how they wanted the site to look, and the inclusion of many
        sliders.</p>
    <p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> HTML, SASS, PHP, JavaScript, PhotoShop, and Illustrator.</p>
